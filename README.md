**Domain:** Web Development  
**Task No:** 4  
**Submitted to:** Oasis Infobyte

## Objective
To design and develop a **Login & Registration Authentication System** using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
The objective was to build a responsive, interactive, and user-friendly system that simulates authentication behavior, including validation, user data management, and UX feedback — all within a fully frontend setup.

## Project Overview
This project represents a **Login & Registration Authentication System** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  

It challenged me to integrate **validation logic**, **user experience design**, and **frontend data handling** together.  

I implemented:
- Real-time form validation & feedback  
- Password visibility toggle and toast alerts  
- LocalStorage-based user handling  
- Responsive design with subtle animations & transitions  
- Simulated API delay to mimic real-world login flow  

This project wasn’t just about creating forms — it was about understanding how **frontend logic and UX design** merge to form a **realistic, production-like authentication system. ⚙️**

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **HTML5:** For structuring the authentication pages  
- **CSS3:** For responsive design, transitions, and UI styling  
- **JavaScript (ES6):** For handling form validation, local storage, and dynamic interactions  
- **Visual Studio Code:** Development environment  
- **Git & GitHub:** For version control and project hosting

## Steps Performed
1. Designed the basic structure for login and registration forms using HTML.  
2. Styled both pages with CSS for responsiveness, animations, and clarity.  
3. Implemented real-time input validation and custom error messages using JavaScript.  
4. Added **password visibility toggles** and **toast notifications** for better UX.  
5. Used **Local Storage** to simulate user registration and authentication.  
6. Introduced a **simulated API delay** to give a realistic loading effect during login.  
7. Tested multiple scenarios to ensure validation and data handling worked as expected.

## Outcome
- A fully functional **Login & Registration System** built entirely with **frontend technologies**.  
- Improved understanding of **form validation**, **user feedback**, and **data persistence**.  
- Hands-on experience with **real-world UI/UX interactions**.  
- Learned how to simulate backend processes using **Local Storage** and delay mechanisms.
